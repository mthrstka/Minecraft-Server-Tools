A collection of Minecraft Bedrock server scripts
--- By Geigus ---

This set of bash scripts allows for easy starting and stopping of a Minecraft bedrock server on a Linux machine.
I use this set of scripts to run a Minecraft Bedrock server on an Oracle Cloud VM (avalible for free!).

TO USE:
1. Set server path and name in config_server.sh
2. Run start_server.sh to start
3. Run stop_server.sh to shut down

DEPENDENCIES:
This program makes use of the following programs that may need to be installed seperately:
1. Screen
2. inotify-tools
