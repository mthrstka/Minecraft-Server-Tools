A collection of Minecraft Bedrock server scripts 
Created by Geigus

This set of bash scripts allows for easy starting and stopping of a Minecraft bedrock server on a Linux machine.
I use this set of scripts to run a Minecraft Bedrock server on an Oracle Cloud VM (avalible for free!).

Designed for Linux systems, however this should also work on MacOS without configuration and Windows with WSL enabled if you needed to run it on one of these (Untested on both) 
Any instructions given will be written with Linux in mind.



FEATURES:

- Easily starting and stopping server without need to memorize commands.
- Monitering of player joining and leaving.
- Automatic pausing/resuming of day/weather cycle when players join and leave.
- Ability to set server announcements that show any time a player joins the game.
- Abitily to set script settings in ./config_server.sh such as auto pausing, auto update, and auto backups (LAST TWO OPTIONS STILL UNRELEASED)



DEPENDENCIES:

This makes use of the following programs that may need to be installed seperately:
- Screen
- inotify-tools



SETUP GUIDE:

1. Clone the repo or download and extract the zip.
2. Download bedrock server zip and extract into the same directory, get it from: https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/bedrock (THIS IS TEMPORARY)
3. Set your server data in server.properties, such as name, port, difficulty, etc.
4. Run ./start_server.sh to start your server, the first run of your server should automatically create your world files.
5. From this point you should be able to leave your server running, but if you need to shut it down for any reason, run ./stop_server.sh



TROUBLESHOOTING:

Can't run any of the files:
- Mark all downloaded files as executable and try again (On Linux, use 'chmod +x FILENAME' to mark each as executable)

Can not open connection to ports:
- Make sure you are allowing tcp and udp on the ports you will be using. If you are using firewalld, this can be done by running 'firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=19132-19133/tcp && firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=19132-19133/udp' (Change the port numbers if not using the defaults)
