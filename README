A collection of Minecraft Bedrock server scripts 
Created by Geigus

This set of bash scripts allows for easy starting and stopping of a Minecraft bedrock server on a Linux machine.
I use this set of scripts to run a Minecraft Bedrock server on an Oracle Cloud VM (avalible for free!).

TO USE:
1. Download bedrock server zip and extract into this directory 
2. Set server path and name in config_server.sh
3. Run start_server.sh to start
4. Run stop_server.sh to shut down
5. Allow connections on the ports you will be using. If you are using firewalld, this can be done by running firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=19132-19133/tcp && firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=19132-19133/udp (Change the port numbers if not using the default)
6. Mark all downloaded files as executable (chmod +x \*_server.sh && chmod +x bedrock_server\*)

DEPENDENCIES:
This makes use of the following programs that may need to be installed seperately:
1. Screen
2. inotify-tools
