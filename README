DEPENDENCIES:

This makes use of the following programs that may need to be installed seperately:
- screen
- wget
- unzip
- inotify-tools


SETUP GUIDE:

1. Clone the repo or download and extract the zip.
2. Run update_server.sh to install Minecraft. (If you do not need to set world/config settings, you can ignore this and skip to step 4)
3. Set your server data in 'server.properties' (in Minecraft's directory, if set seperately), such as name, port, difficulty, etc, and set the actions for your server in 'tools/server.config' (always in this directory, created after updating).
4. Run ./start_server.sh to start your server, the first run of your server should automatically create your world files.
5. From this point you should be able to leave your server running, but if you need to shut it down for any reason, run ./stop_server.sh

EXTRA: To have your sever auto-start, auto-update, automatically backup, etc, create a cronjob ($ crontab -e) or similar to run start_server.sh daily. This can be done with cron by adding the following line:
    @daily /PATH/TO/tools/start_server.sh

    To get in-game messages when your server updates, or has an update, you should add your username to ADMIN_LIST in server.config


ATTENTION ARM USERS:
    Minecraft Bedrock does NOT run on ARM devices, however running this should fix this issue:
    curl --silent https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FEX-Emu/FEX/main/Scripts/InstallFEX.py --output /tmp/InstallFEX.py && python3 /tmp/InstallFEX.py && rm /tmp/InstallFEX.py


FAQ:

My files don't run:
- Mark all downloaded files as executable and try again (use 'chmod +x FILENAME' to mark each as executable)

The server starts but I can't connect:
- Your ports may not be opened. Make sure you are allowing tcp and udp on the ports you will be using. If you are using firewalld, this can be done by running the following (change port numbers if you are not using the defaults):
    firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port=19132-19133/tcp
    firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port=19132-19133/udp
    firewall-cmd --reload

Minecraft's files / Server tools files? Which is which?
- 'Minecraft's files' refers to the files that are used by Minecraft to run the server (things like 'server.properties' and 'worlds/'). Server tools files refer to the files that came with this program, that start, stop, and monitor your server, that Minecraft does not use (such as 'update_server.sh' and 'start_server.sh').

How do I edit the settings of my world?
- Your world's settings can be found inside of 'server.properties'. This will allow you to change things such as the seed, difficulty, gamemode, etc.


OTHER THINGS:

Announcements can be sent through the command line instead of through a file if desired, the syntax for this is:
    ./announce_server.sh -a $ANNOUNCEMENT -p $PLAYER_NAME
